# Effects-Topological-Changes-in-Decision-Making-Urban-Mobility

Master thesis' project in the master degree Physics of Data in University of Padova. Previously, the study of individuals decision-making processes of commuters using various forms of transport within a city were developed. In the present work we have explored the process based on a network that simulates a city. The aim is make some changes in the topology of the network and evaluated the impact and the effects on the decision-making process in order to perform som epublic policies that could be implemented in real scenarios.
